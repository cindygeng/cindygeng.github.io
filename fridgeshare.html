			<div class="overview">
				<div id="title"> Project Overview</div>
				<div id="text"> This was a project for my design class. My team (shoutout to Rose, Lianne, and Sean) and I created FridgeShare, a community fridge shared by students living on college campuses. </div>

			<div class="contribution">
				<div id="title"> My contribution</div>
				<div id="text"> We collaborated equally on every step, and by the end of the class, we had a business model canvas and a mid-fidelity prototype of the fridge’s interface. A few months later, I decided to keep working on this project by designing a mockup of the app as well. </div>

		<div id="section-title"> Problem </div>
		<div class="problem"> 
			<div id="bold1"> Let's talk about food waste</div>
			<div id="regular1"> I’ve lived in my off-campus apartment for two years now. As I adjusted to having to buy groceries to cook, I’ve noticed that I end up throwing away a lot of food because I overbuy or forget about it when it gets lost in the fridge. Many college students can relate to this. The goal is create an alternative solution to try to break this pattern. </div>
			<div id="bold2"> General Problem Statement</div>
			<div id="regular2">Food waste is detrimental to our society — it is a waste of money and damages the environment. We hoped to create a solution that encourages individuals to recognize the consequences and gives them an alternative to throwing food away.</div>
		</div>

		<div id="section-title"> Research </div>
		<div class="research"> 
			<div id="bold1"> Goal</div>
			<div id="regular1">To understand why people end up wasting food, and what methods are used to try to prevent it.</div>
			<div id="bold2"> Interviews</div>
			<div id="regular2">Each of us interviewed two individuals of different levels of expertise in food waste. I interviewed a member of a food sustainability organization, “Berkeley Food Collective”, as well as an employee of a local restaurant. I also read articles and scientific studies to find existing solutions.</div>
			<div id="bold3">Secondary Research</div>
			<div id="regular3"> I researched existing food waste initiatives to find out what has been successful.</div>
		</div>

		<div id="section-title"> Insights </div>
		<div class="insights"> 
			<div id="bold1"> From our research, we discovered:</div>
			<div id="regular1"> 
				<ul>
					<li>1.Although students value money, they tend to forget about the monetary meaning of food after the purchase.</li>
					<li>2.Having extra food at home makes people feel safe</li>
					<li>3.People tend to waste less food if they think they’re being socially judged.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="section-title"> HMW? </div>
		<div class="hmw"> 
			<div id="regular1">On reflection, we realizes that realistically, students would likely not change their buying habits by themselves, due to time constrictions and unstable finances as a college student.  </div>
			<div id="regular2">So, the question is:</div>
			<div id="bold4"> How Might We make students be more conscious of their food disposal habits?</div>
		</div>

		<div id="section-title"> Solution </div>
		<div class="solution"> 
			
			<div id="bold1">FridgeShare is a community fridge installed in a student apartment complex.</div>
			<div id="regular1">How it works: students can sign up to join and share their extra food</div>
			<div id="bold2"> Why a community fridge?</div>
			<div id="regular2">A community fridge with a credit system keeps students accountable and rewards them for sharing food when they realize they have too much. It's a great alternative to just throwing a food item away. This not only encourages individuals to improve, but also forces group effort into decreasing food waste.</div>
